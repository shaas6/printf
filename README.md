# Printf: Our first Goliath

The term **printf** is known by programmers as the function that prints
a formatted string. Within this command are several pre-compiled and
dynamic pieces, all working together to display
numbers, characters, strings, etc.

We were tasked with creating our own, which took a lot of work, which
equated to time and energy spent on understanding what was being asked
of us and languaging it in a way for our computers to understand using the
C programming language.

Here's some insight into that process.

# Daudi's thoughts
Hey everyone, my name is Daudi Lazarre.

The Holberton experience is already challenging, so seeing the printf
project on the intranet a few days before it officially opens is nothing
short of intidimidating. While I can't speak on behalf of everyone's experience,
I can say with utmost confidence that imposter syndrome hit me really hard with
this project my first time around.

Due to my transition from cohort 14 to cohort 15, there are a few traits that
I have noticed in successful individuals and teams, both at Holberton and
especially during the printf project.

Breathe.
Communicate.
Take breaks.
Get gooder at googling.

The first one is a personal practice of my own. I recently learned that
most of us have different breathing patterns (screen apnea) when we interact
with technology, which leads to feelings of panic and destructive
coding practices. Breathe intentionally. Challenge that anxiety with slow, deep
breaths.

The second one is the backbone of success. I personally exercise this when
I have no idea what I'm talking about. I'll say to myself that I'm going to
understand it. Then, I reach out to my cohort members, student tutors, Google,
etc. and I have ALWAYS come back with a deeper understanding of
the task at hand. This leads perfectly into the next point.

This third one is often underappreciated.. Have you ever noticed that the bulk
of programming is all in your head? The C programming language will do exactly
what you tell it and that's annoying. Step away from your computer.
Get some water. Go for a walk. Order some pizza. Do something that has no
relation to the screen you've been staring at for a few hours. More often that
not, this is the time I need to return with a better understanding of where
I left off. Breaks are part of the coding experience, too!

This one is certainly an art form in a few ways. By learning how to Google,
the time browsing on the internet getting lost in function pointer rabbit holes
is greatly reduced. I personally keep my eyes out for three main websites; if
the links provided are not from Stackoverflow, Geeksforgeeks, or tutorialspoint,
I don't want it. It's that simple.
